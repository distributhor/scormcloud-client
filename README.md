# ScormCloud Client

A Typescript and JS client for interfacing with the ScormCloud API. http://www.scorm.com

NOTE: This is currently in early stages of development and not ready for use yet.

API documentaion will be available in both HTML and Markdown. HTML can be found in docs/html, and is easier to navigate and a little more readable. The Markdown documentation is viewable directly on Github, and can be found [here](https://github.com/distributhor/scormcloud-client/blob/main/docs/markdown/README.md)
