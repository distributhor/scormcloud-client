# scormcloud-client

A Typescript and JS client for interfacing with the ScormCloud API. http://www.scorm.com

Currently this is some very initial work and far from ready for use. Will build features and wider support for the full API over the next while.

If/when it reaches some form of maturity, I may open it up and publish it for wider benefit and use.
