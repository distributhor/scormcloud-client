# scormcloud-client

A Typescript and JS client for interfacing with the ScormCloud API. http://www.scorm.com

NOTE: This is currently a brand new project and will be in flux for a few weeks (with the aim of reaching a "V1" state by December 2020). It's not ready for any type of serious use yet. Things may, and probably will, change a lot while trying to get this to a semi-mature state. Features and wider support will be built over the next while.

API documentaion will be found [here](docs/index.html)
