# ScormCloud Client

A Typescript and JS client for interfacing with the ScormCloud API. http://www.scorm.com

NOTE: This is currently a brand new project and will be in flux for a while (aiming to reach a "V1" state by 3rd quarter 2021). It's not ready for any type of serious use yet. Things may, and probably will, change a lot while trying to get this to a more mature state.

API documentaion will be available in both HTML and Markdown. HTML can be found in docs/html, and is easier to navigate and a little more readable. The Markdown documentation is viewable directly on Github, and can be found [here](https://github.com/distributhor/scormcloud-client/blob/main/docs/markdown/README.md)
