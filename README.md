### Description

A Typescript and Javascript client for interfacing with the [Scorm Cloud API](https://rusticisoftware.com/products/scorm-cloud/)

The API documentation for this client [is available here](https://distributhor.github.io/scormcloud-client/index.html)

*Note: This is currently in early stages of development and not ready for production use yet*

**Current status:** At the moment the endpoints covered in the official ["Getting Started"](https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/tutorials/course_registration_launch/) tutorial have been implemented, although not with all the optional settings that are available. The TS typings have also not been fully expanded yet. Having said that, the actions taken in the tutorial can already implemented with this client in it's current state (as shown by the integration tests) - it is functional, just very limited in the scope of which endpoints and optional settings have been implemented, out of all those available. To know what the current state of implementation is, please always refer to the [API documentation](https://distributhor.github.io/scormcloud-client/index.html), which will always reflect the latest state.
